##Ubuntu Users

Please just install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux). Don't even bother with the incredibly outdated packages on ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The newer Ubuntu might be better, but some libraries still cause issues.
source activate root
pip install opensimplex

For testing:
conda install -c conda-forge vtk python=3.6
